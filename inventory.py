# This program is a shoe inventory management system that allows the user to view, add, and modify the inventory of a shoe store. 
# The program uses the tabulate library to display the inventory data in a tabular format, and stores the inventory data in 
# a text file for persistence. The user can view all the shoes in the inventory, add new shoes, re-stock existing shoes, 
# search for a shoe, calculate the value of each item, and see which product has the highest quantity available. 
# The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles to represent each shoe as a Shoe object.
